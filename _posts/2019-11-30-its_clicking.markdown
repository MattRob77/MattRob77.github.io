Rails project is underway and I'm excited for a couple of reasons. One I've been pressed and stretched more on this project  than previous projects, but the fun part is it's starting to click! So far been understanding how to run on errors and not get super down about errors. I do believe I'm learning how to be more error driven to help guide me to a solution. I've started pushing more of my code to github and have learned the value of using the up arrow to copy what I previously type saving mental effort!

Undestanding Crud have also been helpful. Learning more about the single responsibility principle with my controllers and making sure all my routes are working correctly have helped me push past some of my earlier problems. The more I learn to code the more I realize it's all mental! With project week approaching I can say that there are no problems only solutions. To quote Avi "It's not about memorization, but the ability to look things up."
