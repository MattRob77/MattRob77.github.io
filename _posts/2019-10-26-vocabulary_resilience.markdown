What a relief and a lot of satification I got from completing my first project. I wanted to be honest in this post and show that even though there may be doubts about completing a project you can succeed!

Going into my project review I was beyond stressed. I felt like I had a good grasp of the material, but after not passing my first review I needed to go back over some of my vocabulary to complete this section. Yes, it was a bit rough and I had to dig deep while getting over my mindset of feeling like a failure. For anyone that has kept up with my journey you know that I did not have any previous coding experience which gives me motivation to share of the key concepts for a beginner to pass the first project review.

To keys to passing your first project review: 
1. Know the basics - Building off these will serve you with a solid foundation moving forward. 
2. Variable scopes - knowing different variables at different scopes and where you have access to them.
3. Differences between attr_accessors and attr_reader 
4. The meaning of "self" and what value it has in different contexts. 
5. study up on the difference between an instance method and instance variable. 

These are just some of the things I personally would study. Also, I would check out single responsibilty principle. 
At the end of studying these lessons I believe you will be more ready to knock it out of the park! 
Happy coding!
