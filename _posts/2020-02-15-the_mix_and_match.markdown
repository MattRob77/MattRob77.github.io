For my final project using React-Redux and Rails  I decided to build an ecommerce clothing website. When I thought about the project I started with a non-profit application, but decided this was the way to go. I knew going in that I wouldn't host it  just possibly use it as a template for future use for side projects. With this in mind I knew that I didn't need to add any ability to receive payments with paypal or strip api. This application would remain the same as a temp and later on I might add in that functionality to the application.

Here is the checklist I used in building out this application: 

* Written largely using es6 syntax 
* Used create-react-app for creating the application 
* Added container components with two types being presentational and stateless 
* multiple routes applied using Rails back end 
* The use of react-router with  RESTful routing 
* Redux and redux-thunk middleware used to modify state change and make use of async actions to send data and receive data from the server 
* Rails backend to persist the data 
* Make use of async and synch js action creators

The reason I named this blog post Mix and Match was because I ran into some issues gathering resources from mulitple places. The first issue I found was  that gathering information from multiple sources caused my syntax in my code to get weird. I can't stress enough the importance of finding your own style when creating your application.  For instance I had been using CSS for the entirety of my coding journey up until this project when I decided it was a good idea to try SASS out. If you want to check it out google it for the sake of this post I won't go in depth, but basically you can group together CSS. 

The next issue I ran into was done when I started to build my front end first. I decided this was the route to go because I'm a visual person and it helped me to build out the projects in the past. The problem with this project was that I forgot one key ingredient in building out a good app and that is making sure I have all the migrations set up and the schema. I did not add email for my user only username and password, however in my front end I had email for a user to log in.

To answer the elephant in the room I was able to fix these bugs and the MVP for the application is done. Again I might add payments later and possibly a cart component before the review of the project, but I can say I learned a lot about file tree structure and how React-Redux can help with the flow of information throughout  an application.  The road has been up and down and I look forward to what's next in my coding journey I truly feel I have found a home and a new career.
