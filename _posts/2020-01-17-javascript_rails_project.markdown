Made it to my Javascript Project! I never thought that I would be at this stage of the curriculum. I'm beyond thankful for the help from my cohort lead and other cohort students. For this project I decided to build out a movie website that meets the requirements for the project. This app is a single page app, that lets the user add a movie into the database and also deletes the movie from the database. In the coming days I will continue building out a review feature that will allow a user to add a review to a movie already in the database.

I first created two folders one for my backend that would be used for an api and then a frontend that would be used for the client side of things. There are more features I would like to be able to add to this later and possibly upload the app to heroku. I've also been doing more work inside of CSS, but for now I decided to make this app an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). In other words I've basically built out a skeleton app that I can later come back and build out more.

Although my application wasn't as complex as I would of liked it to be I did run into a few problems. My fetch was not grabbing the data, which I had some syntax errors to help guide me to solve the problem. I found that using inpect/console helped with this. The other problem that I had was in my html, js files I was getting errors because I didn't khave the right attributes in my backend in rails. I fixed this by doing a db reset and running a new migration, so I could add them to my schema. 

All in all I'm happy with this stage of the project. I learned a lot about myself and how I process information. I found that I'm getting better at understanding and how I process the information in programming. My favorite part about this application was going back and forth between my backend and frontend. I can see how this will help me with workflow down the line in my career.
