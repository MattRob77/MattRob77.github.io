Growing up I had always been into tech and video games. In my early twenties I enjoyed using programs like photo shop and light room to create marketing ads for multiple organizations. I think deep down I always had this urge to make apps, but didn't know it was possible. I went to school and received my Bachelors in Liberal Arts with an emphasis in Biblical Studies. It wasn't until I moved to New Jersey that I realized another source of income would be needed. After searching for something I was passionate about, I found coding A.K.A software engineering. A friend of the family works for a company that put me in touch with FlatIron  School. After doing my research, I was intrigued and felt this would be a great opportunity.

 From the moment I started the bootcamp and pre-work courses I felt right at home.  The process has been rewarding yet challenging at the same time. There have been many roadblocks while learning, but with the great instructor presence and an affirming community, I truly believe that I can succeed in this program. If you would have told me 4 years ago that I would sit at a computer making tic-tac-toe programs and throwing out as many hashketballs as I could, I would say you were crazy!

With this first week underway, I met my cohort for the months ahead. I am looking forward to starting my  weekly 1:1â€™s, pair programming and continuing blogging about my journey into the matrix known as software engineering. Stay Tuned.
