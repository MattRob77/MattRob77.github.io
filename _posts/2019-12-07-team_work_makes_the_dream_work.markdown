With my Rails application at its end I have lots of thoughts about the journey so far. Coming into another project I wasn't sure what to expect. I felt not ready to complete the task ahead, but true grit, determination and a strong cohort got me the rest of the way. Did I mention that a big shout out to everyone that helped me through this process! There have been many ups, downs, twists and turns during this project, however I made it!

Lets talk a little about the specs on this project now. 

This Rails application should include: 

- Using Ruby on Rails for the project
-  Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y; e.g. User has_many Recipes)
- Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y; e.g. Post belongs_to User)
- Include at least two has_many through relationships (x has_many y through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
- Include at least one many-to-many relationship (x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients, Item has_many Recipes through Ingredients)
- The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
- Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
- Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
- Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
- Include login (how e.g. Devise)
- Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
- Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
- Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
- Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
- Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

The face of Kevin Mcallister says it all! Huge task yes, but at the end I can say it's been highly rewarding experience. Having help from a team helped a lot I could go to them with questions and when I entire ruby stopped working because of an update I had people that helped make the dream work. In the middle of my project somehow my bash profile got deleted causing a lot of glitches, so hours and a lot of documentation the issue had been fixed. My CLIENT ID for my google authentication had been also deleted. Which brings me to an important point, that having the ability to look up resources and documentation could be the deciding factors if the project will succeed or not. Ruby-doc and Stackoverflow helped me through some issues moving forward I would want to go back over line for line and understand more of what the code is doing.

All in all this project has been the most challenging yet the most rewarding. I not only learned more about coding, but got to know some great future changers in my cohort. I wouldn't have changed these moments for anything and I look forward to continuing on with my education and Javascript moving forward. Not to worry I haven't forgot about my application! I think this one will stick with me and give me something to work on more in the future.
